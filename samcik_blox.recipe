    # BBC feeds.

    # The max age of articles which may be downloaded from each feed. This is
    # specified in days - note fractions of days are allowed, Eg. 2.5 (2 and a
    # half days). My default of 1.5 days is the last 36 hours, the point at
    # which I've decided 'news' becomes 'old news', but be warned this is not
    # so good for the blogs, technology, magazine, etc., and sports feeds.
    # You may wish to extend this to 2-5 but watch out ebook creation time will
    # increase as well. Setting this to 30 will get everything (AFAICT) as long
    # as max_articles_per_feed remains set high (except for 'Click' which is
    # v. low volume and its currently oldest article is 4th Feb 2011).

    # Number of simultaneous downloads. 20 is consistantly working fine on the
    # BBC News feeds with no problems. Speeds things up from the defualt of 5.
    # If you have a lot of feeds and/or have increased oldest_article above 2
    # then you may wish to try increasing simultaneous_downloads to 25-30,
    # Or, of course, if you are in a hurry. [I've not tried beyond 20.]
